#### Knowledge Rich Design
- Devs refactor the implementation to express the model and give the application use of that knowledge
- It's not good to hide business rules in a hidden guard clause in an application since:
	- It's unlikely and business expert could read this code to verify the rule
	- It would be difficult for a technical, non-business person to connect the requirement text with the code
- When this is the case, we can make use of the strategy pattern
