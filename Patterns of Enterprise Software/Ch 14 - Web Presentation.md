- Splits user interface into three distinct roles
- MVC considers three roles:
	- The Model is an object that represents some information about the domain. It's a non-visual object containing all the data and behaviour other than that used for the UI.
	- The View represents the display of the model in the UI.
	- The Controller takes the user input, manipulates the model, and causes the view to update appropriately
  - The UI is often a combination of the view and controller
  - MVC is used to principally separate the presentation from the model and to separate the controller from the view
  - Fundamentally, presentation and model are about different concerns
