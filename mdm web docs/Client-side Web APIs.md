### Intro

- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.
- Browser APIs are built into your web browser and are able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it. For example, the Web Audio API provides JS constructs for manipulating audio in the browser.
- Third Party APIs are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to retrieve their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example, Google Maps API allows you to do things like display an interactive map to your office on your website.
- Javascript libraries: Usually one or more JS files containing custom functions that you can attach to your webpage to speed up or enable writing common functionality.
- JS Frameworks: Tend to be packages of HTML, CSS, JS and other technologies that you install and then use to write an entire web application from scratch. The key difference between a framework and library is "Inversion of Control". When calling a method from a library, developer is in control. With a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls the developers code.
