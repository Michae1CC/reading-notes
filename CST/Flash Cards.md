Access Control (what is it)
- Ensuring authorised access to a resource

Examples of Access Control common violations
- Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default, where access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone
- Forced browsing to access parts of a website that shouldn’t normally be accessible – directory traversal, hidden web pages
- CORS misconfiguration

Examples of Access Control common prevention strategies
- Except for public resources, deny by default
- Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application, including minimizing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) usage
- Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate
