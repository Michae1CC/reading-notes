- cryptographic key lifetime

Usefulness of Cryptoperiod
- Limit the amount of information and time available for cryptanalysis
- Limit the exposure if a single key is exposed
- Limit the use of a particular algorithm

Factors affecting the length of Cryptoperiods
- Volume of data flow or number of transactions
- Cryptographic method
- Rekeying method

Digital certificates (Update)
- Bind an entity to a public key and are digitally signed by a trusted third-party

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) (Update)
