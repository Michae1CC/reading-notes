Shift Left Security
- Incorporating security requirements, security design and security testing earlier in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

Goals of Shift Left Security
- Identify security design flaws & vulnerabilities as early as possible in the development lifecycle.
- Ensure secure design principles are applied during the design phase

Shift Left Security Common Practices
- Security Policy
- Threat Modelling
- Secure Coding Practices

Shift Left Security - Separation of Privilege
- For highly sensitive operations, split responsibilities between two or more people
- No single person has complete control; requires collusion to exploit

NIST Secure Software Development Framework
- A set of high-level practices based on established standards, guidance and existing secure software development practices
- Provides a basis for planning and implementing a risk-based approach to implementing secure software development practices

Zero Trust
- A security model that eliminates implicit trust, instead focusing on the continuous evaluation of explicit access and trust levels

Zero Trust Tenets
- Assumes a hostile network; that is that an attacker is present
- Does not assume trust based on granted access to a network
- Continuously evaluates trust based on client identity, device characteristics, behavioural and environmental attributes

Zero Trust Assumptions
- Devices on the network may not be owned or configurable by the enterprise
- Remote enterprise subjects and assets cannot fully trust their local network connection
- Assets and workflows moving between enterprise and non-enterprise infrastructure should have a consistent security policy and posture
